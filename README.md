# [IN4334] Mining Software Repositories

This repository contains the code of the assignments and of the final paper of the course IN4334 "Mining Software Repositories" at TU Delft, taught in Q1 2016/17.

In collaboration with @MiliasV, @ajayaadhikari and @Harrisval.

## Assignments

The two assignments were about the prediction of bugs in a software repository (Apache Lucene).

We had to compute a set of statistics about the development of the files and the bug introduction information.

In the corresponding folders the Python code and the CSV output files can be found.

## Final paper

As part of the course we had to analyse and extend a chosen paper. We decided to work on the paper [How, and Why, Process Metrics Are Better](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486846) by Rahman et al, 2013.

In the `report` folder the paper in PDF format can be found, together with all the code that was involved in the creation of the paper.
